# AVL-TREES
This project acts to replicate and test the functionality of an AVL Tree implemented in Java. The tree must be a self-rotating binary search tree that maintains completeness and a level difference of no more than 1. In addition, the Breadth First Iterator acts to return results in BFS order with the associated tree.
